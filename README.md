## jweath _(J-WeatherApp 2.0)_
☁️A fully responsive web application to view realtime weathers from places around the world with 24 hours forecast created with **NextJS (TypeScript)** and **Tailwind CSS** which provides some fun and interactive features such as _Infinite Scrolling_ and _Parallax Scrolling_. 

ℹ️This application is an improved version of <a href="https://github.com/je-von/j-weatherapp">J-WeatherApp</a>, but this time I used REST API from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" title="Weather API">WeatherAPI.com</a>

🌐To experience and interact with the web live, you can click <a href="http://jweath.vercel.app">here</a>.
